A JFlex and Cup implementation for the C- language.

Note that you may need to modify the classpath in the Makefile so that it
will point to the directory where "java_cup" is located.

To build the parser, type "make" in the current directory, which will
generate an executable program called "tiny".

To test source code like "1.cm", type

`java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM 1.cm`


To display the syntax tree on the screen, type

`java -classpath /usr/share/java/cup.jar:. CM -a 1.cm`


To rebuild the parser, type "make clean" and type "make" again.

For testing purposes, [12345].cm files have been provided.
